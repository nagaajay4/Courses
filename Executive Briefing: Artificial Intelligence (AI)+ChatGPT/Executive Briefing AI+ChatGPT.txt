Executive Briefing: AI+ChatGPT


1. Computer Vision

What is CV
Trains computers to interpret and understand the visual world

Ex: cameras auto focusing on face, 
facebook suggests whom to tag in the facebook post, self diriving cars


Human process 90% of data in visual form


How CV works
Myth: CV only works with Deep learning and neural networks

Types of CV
Classical: relies on prebuilt libraries of features
Efficient and extremely fast

Deep Learning: convolutional neural networks make possible deep learning for computer vision
black box that has memory and experience fed with labelled data before using

Example:
Tomato sorting with CV
good and rotten tomato sorting

Applications
Image classification
Image segmentation
object detection
Object tracking
Image generation
Edge detection
Face detection
Face recognization
Optical charcater recognization OCR
Pattern detection
Feature matching


Use Cases
1. SKanska, one of the largest construction companies in the world determined that their workers walked more than 6miles per day just to gather the items

Skanska optimized the entire building process

2. Tesla uses CV in self driving cars

3. Harvest Croo Robotics: Computer Vision for automatic crop Harvesting


4. ebay : Cv for image search

5. Ai cure: computer vision for medication adherence

6. Osprey:  Computer vision for oil well monitoring

7. Roaf : CV for waste sorting

8. Swiss Federal Institute of Technology: CV for stroke recovery

9. Cortexica : CV for workplace safety monitoring

10. Tomra: Computer vision for auotmatic ore sorting


2. Deep learning

family of machine learning methods based on artifical neural networks


Discipline within AI that teaches computers how to make predictions based on date

No predefined framework
mimic human brain
Deep neural networks


Al>Ml(NLP+CV+RL)>DL(DNLP+DCV+DRL not always)

Building Neural networks

input layer
Hidden layer
output layer

The different ways that neural networks can be constructed are called architectures


How neural networks learn

Neural networks have memory which is effecitively weights whithin these neurons
weights are trained
weights are adjusted using back propagation


10 Use cases

1. Google Ai: deep learning for cancer detection
2. Spotify : deep learning for recommendation engines
3.Goldspot Discoveries:  DP for mineral exploration
4.digital domain: DP for visual effects
5. Ayasdi: DP for anti-money laundering
6. Deep instinct: DP for cybersecurity
7. Doxel: DP for productivity tracking
8. Amazon rekognition: DP for facial recognition
9. Zestimate: DP for real estate prices
10. Zest Finance: deep learning for loan approval


4. Reinforcement Learning RL

Three types of algorithms
Supervised learning: Teach a machine to search and identify patterns, labelled data

UnSupervised learning: discover of new patterns, clustering, suggestions

Reinforcement learning : presenrted with a problem and is being rewarded with a plus one for  finding a solution or punished with minus one for not finding a solution, agent take random actions and interact with environment


RL in HUmans
baby learning to walk
reward
punishment

Application
Marketing
1. Creating personalized recommendations
2. Optimizing adversting budget
3. selecting the best content for advertisements
4. Increasing customer lifetime value
5. Predicting customer responses to price plan changes

10 use cases:

6. Electa: RL in energy managemnt
7. Fanuc/Tesla: manufacturing and robotics
8. inventory management
9. Cambridge unveristy: healthcare
10. Self driving cars by Tesla google and more



5. Natural Language Processing NLP

Field of AI concerned with the interactions between computers and human natural languages

program computers to process and analyse large amounts of natural language data

two types of data
Structured data(predefined format)(tables, databases)
Unstructured data(Emails,chats, blogs, books)


NLP works
two parts
Natural language understanding
Mapping the given input form NL into formal representation and analysing it

Natural language generation
NLG is munch easier than NLU

speech recognition and speech generation only come to play if there's audio involved


Applications of NLP

Sentiment Analysis: TO help you understand how users feel about your company or product
speech recognizantion
chatbots
machine translation
autocompleting text
spell checking
keyword search
advertisment matching
information extraction
spam detection
text generation
automatic summaraztio
Questionsanswering
image captioning
video captioning


Chatbots

simple chatbots: use minimal NLP they are precoded to a certain set of questions and responses

Advanced chatbots: heavily rely on NLP specifcally NLU interacting with customers as a human would

10 usecases
NLP in
